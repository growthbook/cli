## growthbook constant-revisions revert

Revert the constant to a prior revision

### Synopsis

Creates a new draft (or immediately publishes) whose content matches the specified historical revision. Defaults to creating a draft; when the org enables 'reverts bypass approval' it defaults to publishing immediately. Pass `strategy` to override.

```
growthbook constant-revisions revert [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  growthbook constant-revisions revert --key <key> --version-param <value>
```

### Options

```
      --body string                        Request body as JSON (alternative to individual flags). Can also be provided via stdin.
  -c, --comment string                     string value
  -h, --help                               help for revert
  -i, --ignore-warnings                    Set to true to acknowledge the warnings listed in a blocked response and continue. This covers experiment guards, locked dependents, and references affected by an archive. When the organization treats schema failures as warnings, it also covers schema and invariant warnings. It never bypasses a rejected Custom Hook. On revision publish endpoints, it can also force-publish an out-of-date draft when the caller has Bypass draft approvals access.
  -k, --key string                         [required]
      --skip-hooks skipSchemaValidation    Set to true to publish despite a Custom Hook rejection. This does not bypass schema validation; use skipSchemaValidation for that. The caller must have Bypass draft approvals access for Feature Flags, Configs, and Constants in every Project. Otherwise, this field is ignored.
      --skip-schema-validation skipHooks   Set to true to publish despite schema validation errors, failed invariants, or schema changes that invalidate dependent resources. This does not bypass a rejected Custom Hook; use skipHooks for that. The caller must have Bypass draft approvals access for Feature Flags, Configs, and Constants in every Project. Otherwise, this field is ignored.
      --strategy draft                     Whether to stage the revert as a draft or publish it immediately. Defaults to draft, or to `publish` when the org enables 'reverts bypass approval'. (options: draft, publish)
  -t, --title string                       string value
  -v, --version-param string               [required]
```
